Multitasking kernel assignment University of Waikato 2022\

Requires Waikato WRAMP board simulator.\
Software environment\
We will use a two applications from COMPX203. The source code and released binaries (executables) are at [https://github.com/wandwramp](https://github.com/wandwramp)

toolchain: Tools that you need to assemble and compile the code. Runs only in Linux:\
1.wasm (wramp assembler)\
2.wlink (wramp linker),\ 
3.wobj (wramp object viewer)\
4.wcc: C compiler targeted at the WRAMP architecture to combine C code and assembly.
(note: 'wcc' is its own separate source code package which needs to be compiled up after the command-line tools provided in 'toolchain' has been compiled)
wsim: An app that simulates the wramp hardware, to allow you to develop and test on a PC without the hardware.  Runs in Windows or Linux
